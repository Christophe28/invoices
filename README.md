# Invoices

With the aim of learning the basics of Typescript and Redux Toolkit, I decided to follow a template on Figma proposed by a mentor. The main challenge was to work with Typescript and Redux Toolkit and then utilize them effectively. The project is currently 'viable' for a demonstration, but there are still some details to be addressed, such as refactoring (in progress), as well as correcting the values indicated in the initial demonstration invoices.
